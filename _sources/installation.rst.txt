Installation
============

This guide will help you install and set up the **lback** framework on your local machine.

Requirements
------------

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package installer)
- virtualenv (optional but highly recommended for managing project dependencies in an isolated environment)

Installation Steps
------------------

To ensure a smooth installation and proper functioning of Lback Framework, especially for file handling features, please follow these steps:

1. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**

It's highly recommended to create a dedicated virtual environment for your project. This isolates your project's dependencies and prevents conflicts with other Python projects on your system.

    .. code-block:: bash

        # Create a virtual environment named 'venv' in your project directory
        python3 -m venv venv

        # Activate the virtual environment

        # On macOS and Linux:
        source venv/bin/activate

        # On Windows:
        .\venv\Scripts\activate

Once activated, your terminal prompt will typically show `(venv)` indicating you are in the virtual environment.

2. **Install System-level Dependencies (for File Type Detection)**

Lback Framework utilizes `python-magic` for robust file type detection.

This Python library relies on a native system library called `libmagic`.

You need to install `libmagic` using your system's package manager **before** installing Lback's Python packages.

**For macOS and Linux users:**

**On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems:**

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install libmagic

**On Fedora/RHEL/CentOS-based systems:**

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo dnf install file-libs # or sudo yum install file-libs

**On macOS (using Homebrew):**

    .. code-block:: bash

        brew install libmagic

**For Windows users:**

No manual steps are typically required for `libmagic`.

Lback's installation process will automatically handle this dependency for you using `python-magic-bin`.

3. **Install lback from PyPI**

Once your virtual environment is activated (if you chose to use one), you can install lback using pip:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install lback-framework

4. **create a project**:

   .. code-block:: bash

       lback startproject myproject

   Replace ``myproject`` with your desired project name.

5. **Run initial setup**:

   .. code-block:: bash

       python manage.py makemigrations
       python manage.py migrate
       python manage.py create_superuser
       python manage.py runserver



You should now be able to access the application in your browser at ``http://127.0.0.1:8000``.
